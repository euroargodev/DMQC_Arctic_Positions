# DMQC_Arctic_Positions
Repository for code, data and discussion about the Position DMQC of Argo floats in the Arctic (aka interpolation of missing positions)

(In development) Plots for DMQC operators:
1 Matlab Figure (so one can zoom in, out, check data values, etc) in which one sees all:
- Positions as they are in the file (+posqc flag)
- All the interpolated trajectories available (ForwLat & ForwLon, BackwLat & BackLon, TrajLat & TrajLon in the CSV file) using https://github.com/euroargodev/Coriolis-under-ice-positioning
- Shows detailed bathymetry
